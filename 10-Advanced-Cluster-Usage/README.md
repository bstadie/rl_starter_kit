## Introduction

VSCode has a nice integration with remote access, which is how we usually access Quest. VSCode offers two ways to connect to Quest via SSH, either by password authentication or by public key authentication. Once connected, the terminal can be accessed in a view on VSCode and SLURM jobs can be easily sent to the queue within the VSCode window. 

## Setting up VSCode for Remote Access

VSCode comes with several extesions and plugins that can be downloaded. When VSCode is open, find the settings gear icon in the lower left corner and select 'Extensions' from the drop down. There are three extensions to install. All three are published and owned by Microsoft.

- Remote - SSH 
- Remote - SSH: Editing Config Files
- Remote Explorer

Once these extensions are loaded, VSCode is ready to connect to remote servers.
