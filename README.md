# rl_starter_kit
Running RL code Locally, on Slurm, on Lambda Labs, and on GCP. 

For many RL projects, using high performance computing is essential.
We have run into many issues lately launching experiments efficiently on our cluster.
The aim of this project is to establish a set of best practices for coding on the cluster.
